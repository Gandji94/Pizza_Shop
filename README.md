# Pizza_Store

In the following project, a pizza storeâ€™s (with made up data) performance was analyzed. I have uploaded the data of the store in a data base, in this data base I have used SQL code to manipulate the data.
Manipulation methods:
- Aggregation functions(sum(), count() etc.)
- Window function (lag() and row_number())
- Strftime() to dissect the date into multiple parts
- Instr() to separate string values
- CTE
- Temporary tables
The output of the data manipulation is displayed in the attached link to the tableau report. The link will bring you to the main report from where you can go deeper in the different sections of the report.
The report will display:
## Pizza Store Report
