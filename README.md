# Pizza_Shop

A pizza shop's annual performance in 2015 was analyzed in the following project. I have uploaded the store's data to a database. In this database, I have used SQL code to manipulate the data.
Manipulation methods:
- Aggregation functions(sum(), count() etc.)
- Window function (lag() and row_number())
- Strftime() to dissect the date into multiple parts
- Instr() to separate string values
- CTE
- Temporary tables

The output of the data manipulation is displayed in the attached link to the tableau report. The link will bring you to the main report, where you can go deeper into the different sections.

The report will display:
