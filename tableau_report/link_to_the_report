#READ BEFORE YOU USE THE LINK

This link will bring you to the "Pizza Shop Report". This report works like a landing page. When you click on the different visualizations
you will get to the two dashboards "Breakdown of the Orders" and "Pizza Shop Performance".
You will be able to return to the "Pizza Shop Report" when you click on the pie chart while you are in the "Breakdown of the Orders"
dashboard.
If you are in the "Pizza Place Performance" dashboard, you have to click on the "Quaterly Revenue" visualization
to return to the "Pizza Place Report".
